## 🌟 Vision
**SmartHire** is a truly autonomous AI recruitment platform designed to eliminate human bias and identify top-tier talent through deep reasoning. We're moving beyond simple keyword matching to understanding *how* candidates think and solve problems.

## 🛠️ Core Technology Pillars

### 1. 🛡️ Zero Bias Protocol (PII Obfuscation)
Evaluates candidates purely as anonymous skill vectors. All Personally Identifiable Information (PII) is stripped at ingestion to ensure a 100% merit-based evaluation process.

### 2. 🧠 Deep Reasoning Engine
Powered by **L8 Chain-of-Thought (CoT)** analysis, our engine evaluates candidate responses by tracing their logic, not just checking for keywords. It understands context, complexity, and problem-solving depth.

### 3. 👁️ Sentinel System (Biometric Analysis)
Leveraging **MediaPipe**, Sentinel tracks 468 facial landmarks at 60Hz during interviews to measure genuine engagement, cognitive load, and authenticity, ensuring an objective assessment of soft skills.

### 4. 🧬 Resonance Engine (Semantic Matching)
High-dimensional vector embeddings (**BGE-M3**) create a 'resonance' between candidate profiles and job requirements, discovering non-obvious fit patterns that human recruiters often miss.
